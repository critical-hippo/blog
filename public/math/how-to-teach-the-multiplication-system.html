                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>It's easy to teach how the long multiplication system works. But as easy as it is, none of my
                        teachers from elementary school ever taught me how. Maybe they also never knew how it worked or
                        deemed it unnecessary. Whichever it was, it would be great if everyone knew how it did. As some
                        Indian guy said, "Be the change you wish to see in the world." In this article, you will see how
                        long multiplication works and how to teach it.

                    <h2>Digits After a Decimal Point</h2>
                    <p>Before we start, it is necessary to remember that decimal points function like ordinary digits.
                        They're just after a dot. The most important part about them is remembering where the decimal
                        point should be. This detail is why 1.2<sup>2</sup> is 1.44 and 12<sup>2</sup> is 144.</p>

                    <h2>How Carrying Works</h2>
                    <p>When adding or multiplying, we often get a number higher than 9. Of course, this gives us a
                        two-digit number, which we can <i>not</i> add to the digit in the ones' place due to our number
                        system's limitations.</p>

                    <img src="how-to-teach-the-multiplication-system.d/carrying-wrong.png" alt="wrong carrying example">

                    <p>Due to that, you cannot add it to the ones' place. Conveniently, however, the number at the tens
                        place of the answer <i>can</i> take that number because the excess digit is in the tens place.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Main Part: Multiplication</h2>

                    <p>I once forgot the system's direction whenever I multiplied with a two-digit multiplier. I once
                        felt embarrassed as I needed to look it up. But when I realized how it worked, I was never
                        confused again.</p>

                    <p>As you can see in the image below, there's a hidden zero never written down,
                        similar to how some people do not write down the preceding zero in division.</p>
                    <img src="how-to-teach-the-multiplication-system.d/no-zeroes.png" alt="">
                    <p>When we don't write out the zeroes, it gives the illusion that it goes to the left.
                    <p>

                    <p>But let's address the elephant in the room. Why <i>do</i> we add a zero in the first place? The
                        following image illustrates it well.</p>
                    <img src="how-to-teach-the-multiplication-system.d/adding-the-products.png" alt="">
                    <p>As you can see, we split them up by ones, tens, hundreds, etc., and add them all afterward.
                        It shows how simple the system is. It uses basic mathematical concepts that you may have learned
                        in 1st grade.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="outro">
                    <h2>Finishing words</h2>
                    <p>We should teach these not as a set of rules but for what it is. If you ignore the words, it only
                        took two images to show how multiplication works, which says a lot. I think teachers should
                        spend a mere 20 minutes at most explaining how it works. That alone is enough.
                    <p>

                    <p>It may be beautiful, but it's not the best we can do. If you've ever heard of the Trachtenberg
                        system for
                        multiplication, you'll see how much simpler it is. You may also value the complex tricks used in
                        Vedic
                        maths that the ancient Indians made. I believe our education systems should give those a try.
                        They're
                        easier to calculate mentally, too. I may discuss those in the future if I feel like it.</p>
