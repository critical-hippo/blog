        <h1>How to Teach The Multiplication System</h1>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>It's easy to teach how the long multiplication system works. But as easy as it is, none of my
                        teachers from elementary school ever taught it to me. Honestly, it would be great if everyone knew how it did. As some
                        Indian guy said, "Be the change you wish to see in the world." 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Digits After a Decimal Point</h2>
                    <p>Before we start, it's necessary to remember that decimal points function like ordinary digits.
                        They're just after a dot. The most important part about them is remembering where the decimal
                        point should be. That's why 1.2<sup>2</sup> is 1.44 and 12<sup>2</sup> is 144.</p>

                <li id="carrying">
                    <h2>How Carrying Works</h2>
                    <p>When adding or multiplying, we often get a number higher than 9. Of course, this gives us a
                        two-digit number that we can <i>not</i> add to the digit in the ones' place. This is due to our number
                        system's limitations.</p>

                    <img src="how-to-teach-the-multiplication-system.d/carrying-wrong.png" alt="wrong carrying example">

                    <p>As you can see, you cannot add it to the ones' place. Conveniently, however, the number at the tens
                        place of the answer <i>can</i> take that number because the excess digit is in the tens place.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Main Part: Multiplication</h2>

                    <p>I once forgot the system's direction while I was multiplying with a two-digit multiplier. I
                        felt embarrassed as I needed to look it up. But when I discovered how it worked, I was never
                        confused again.</p>

                    <p>As you can see in the image below, there's a hidden zero not written down,
                        similar to how some people do not write down the preceding zero in division.</p>
                    <img src="how-to-teach-the-multiplication-system.d/no-zeroes.png" alt="illustration of the hidden zero">
                    <p>When we don't write out the zeroes, it gives the illusion that it shifts to the left.
                    <p>

                    <p>But let's address the elephant in the room. Why <i>do</i> we add zeroes in the first place? The
                        following image illustrates it well.</p>
                    <img src="how-to-teach-the-multiplication-system.d/adding-the-products.png" alt="">
                    <p>As you can see, we split them up by ones, tens, hundreds, and so on. We only add them all afterward.
                        This demonstrates how simple it is. It uses basic mathematical concepts that you probably learned
                        in 1st grade.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="outro">
                    <h2>Finishing words</h2>
                    <p>We should teach these not as a set of rules but for what it is. If you ignore the words, it only
                        took two images to show how multiplication works, which says a lot. Teachers should
                        spend 5-20 minutes explaining how it works. That alone is enough.
                    <p>

                    <p>It may be enough for some, but it's not the best we can do. If you've ever heard of the Trachtenberg
                        system for
                        multiplication, you'll see how much simpler it is. You may also value the genius tricks used in
                        Vedic
                        maths that the ancient Indians made. I believe our education systems should give those a try.
                        They're even
                        easier to calculate with mentally. If you want me to discuss the Trachtenberg system, email me. If I get 5 emails, I'll consider it.</p>
